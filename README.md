# ðŸ§® String Calculator (TDD Approach)

A simple string-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`) on comma-separated numbers.  
Built with **Node.js** and developed using the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach using **Jest**.

## ðŸ§ª Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This project follows the **TDD** cycle:

1. **Write a failing test** for the smallest piece of functionality
2. **Implement** just enough code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor** while keeping tests green âœ…

Every feature, including error handling and arithmetic operations, was written **after writing tests first** in `calculator.test.js`.
